## About
Started as a slow bignum implementation like in bc-calculator, this project evolved into 
much faster variant thanks to information provided by LibTomMath library creators 
Tom St Denis, Mads Rasmussen, Greg Rose.

Although writing bignum library is not very practical (I did NOT do it from scratch), 
I have to admit it was a lot of fun and a lot of struggle during debugging.
