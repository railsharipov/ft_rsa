## About
Started as a slow bignum implementation like in bc-calculator, this project evolved into 
much faster variant thanks to information provided by LibTomMath library creators 
Tom St Denis, Mads Rasmussen, Greg Rose.
Although writing bignum library from scratch is not very practical, I have to admit
it was a lot of fun and a lot of struggle during debugging.
